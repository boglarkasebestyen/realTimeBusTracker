# Real-time Bus Tracker

This exercise demonstrates checking active bus routes in real time located between Boston University and MIT in Boston, MA and shows the buses on the map by having a marker on them. Please, be aware that the update is slow.
<br/>
<br/>
The tracker is implemented using the [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) JavaScript library and requesting data using the [API](https://www.mbta.com/developers) of the Massachusetts Bay Transportartion Authority. The implementation includes key concepts such as DOM manipulation and asynchronous programming.

## How to run

Clone the respository and open the index.html file in your browser of choice. 

## Future improvements
* Using an API that covers a Californian transportation route, such as BART for Northern California. 
* Adding a marker on the starter- and the destination point.

## Additional information
I also have an implementation of a moving marker on the BART route from San Francisco to San Jose, California. However, this was done by providing every BART station's location coordinate. The files for this version are uploaded [here](https://github.com/boglarkasebestyen/boglarkasebestyen.github.io/tree/master/1st_semester_assignments/bartTracker).
